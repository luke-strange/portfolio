    Hi! I am a Data Scientist/Engineer working at <a href="https:\\open-innovations.org">one of the UK's leading and longest-lived Open Data 
    and Innovation institutions.</a> I made this website using <a href="https:\\lume.land">Lume</a>, a fast & flexible static site generator.
    It's primarily a site for me to keep everything in one place; I hope you find what you're looking for.

<div class='grid'>
    {{ for page of search.pages('navorder>0', 'navorder') }}
        {{# <p><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></p> #}}
        {{ comp.navgrid({ heading: page.title, link: page.url, colour: page.colour }) }}
    {{ /for }}
